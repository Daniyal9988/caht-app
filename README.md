## Chat Application 
This Chat Application was built using React, Express, Node.js, and Socket.io, offering a seamless real-time messaging experience. The front-end, powered by React, provides an intuitive user interface, while the Express-based back-end ensures efficient data handling and communication. Socket.io enables instantaneous message delivery, making it ideal for group chats. Users can easily join conversations using personalized usernames.


**Update:** Regrettably, the front-end repository has been removed from GitHub, and there's no available backup on my local machine. Apologies for any inconvenience.
