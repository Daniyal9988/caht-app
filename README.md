## Chat Application 
Chat Application with React, Express, Node.js, and Socket.io. The front-end was developed using React, while the back-end was implemented in Express. Socket.io was utilized for real-time messaging feature. It's a group chat application where users can join using their username.

**Update:** Unfortunately, the front-end was deleted from GitHub, and I don't have a backup on my local machine :(
